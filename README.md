# DUET
This project aims to connect people through shared musical interests, creating friendships and community by analyzing Spotify activity to match users with similar tastes and recommending concerts to promote activities to build relationships. Unlike dating-focused platforms, it emphasizes connections, whether platonic or romantic, centered around music. Built with Flutter for mobile and web compatibility, the backend uses Firebase, including Firestore and Firebase Auth for real-time data and authentication, and with Metaâ€™s Send API allowing chat features. Its unique concert recommendation feature sets it apart by offering users a way to strengthen connections through shared experiences, helping them discover local events/concerts that align with their music preferences. This provides a safe and natural setting to meet in person, strengthening the bond formed through the platform.

> We aim to get users that feel connection off our platform onto their existing social media
